    Challenge:
    The classic number guessing game.
    The computer picks a number between 1 and 100, and asks you to guess.
    It tells you if you were too high or too low, and gives you six chances to guess.

    Problem Steps:
    1. Give the user the rules to play the game (including that they have 6 chances to guess)
    2. Print - You have {number} of guesses
    3. Ask user to guess a number between 1 and 100
    4. Decrease the guesses count by 1
    5. Check if the guessed number is correct
    6. If correct, user wins - print 'You guessed correctly!' and end the game
    7. If the number is too high - print 'Your guess is too high'
    8. Repeat steps 2 - 6
    9. If the number is too low - print 'Your guess is too low'
    10. Repeat steps 2 - 6
    11. When guess == 0, print 'Too bad, you've run out of guesses' and end the game
