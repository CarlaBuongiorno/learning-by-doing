# If You're API And You Know It Clap Your Hands

## Your Mission


## What Are We Doing Exactly?


# Restrictions
* You should be able to run the finished system from the command line, and you should also have unit tests for your classes.
* Remember that we want this system to be flexible; test that you can pass different numbers of requirements into your PasswordChecker.
* Your program should be split up into modules; you can do this at your own discretion, but you should at least keep your `main` in a different module from your class defintions..
* Your module `main.py` contains your import guard and your main function.
* `main.py` *should* be as simple as possible. Most of your program's logic should be in the classes.
* Each test may only have one assert.
* Gijs Compensation Measures are still in effect: no globals.
* As standard from now on, no raw code; everything must be in a function apart from import guards, constants, and decorators.
* A hint; the PasswordChecker needs at least one Requirement in order to do anything useful. Maybe write one of the Requirements first?
